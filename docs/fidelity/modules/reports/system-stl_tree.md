# system/stl_tree.h attribution reconciliation

Updated 2026-11-05.

2 equal, 4 fixed, 5 intentional (11 entries).

The CVAOPacket lower/upper bounds match. Missing native node insertion and subtree erasure are restored, using actual native field sizes and the existing native rebalance ABI. The packet global destructor no longer calls Shutdown and resets live header/status fields that Mac does not reset. The string-key tree and its global lifetime are replaced by the native external shader cache, separately from the still-active packet tree.

The Mac binary and actual native owners were read directly; no other worker’s verdict replaced binary evidence. Build/guard verification and runtime limitations are recorded in [system/basic_string.h](system-basic_string.md).

## Integrated batch 14 verification

Integrated source 8cf8aa8 passed both dedicated builds, complete local CI 02–13, native-only source guards, parent and fresh independent reviews, and both 2,000-frame replays. No changed source uses line macros. Replay players, state hashes and entities exactly match both 819d282 baselines and each other; all six Linux logic fields agree, with maximum origin drift 0.11792 and velocity drift 2.0. No new tests or i386 byte-parity claim.

This batch closes 880 entries. Fixes cover image metadata/mips and descriptor storage, container/sorting behavior, shader ownership, and the eight-byte AbsoluteTime caller/provider ABI. Three System constructor/factory boundaries and six import/allocation boundaries remain unchecked. Microphone capture remains unsupported. Dedicated replay does not exercise client rendering, shader/context lifetime, device output, or dormant platform wrappers. Unreached client and error paths remain compiled and reviewed; local fixtures establish only their stated cases.
