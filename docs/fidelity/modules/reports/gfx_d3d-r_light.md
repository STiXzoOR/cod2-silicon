# gfx_d3d/r_light module reconciliation

Updated 2026-11-05.

4/4 reconciled: 2 equal, 1 fixed, 1 intentional. Mac 1.3 i386 is the primary authority.

Light selection now follows the unordered-aware scan branches at 0xedea5/0xedf64, restarting its forward scan after each swap. The surface-distance branch at 0xee0da accepts unordered values too. Radius-square operation order, reverse surface append order and partition compaction were checked. RegisterLightDef keeps defined error arguments: the original full-limit diagnostic supplies one value to a format requiring two; copying that invalid variadic read would not give defined native behavior.

All assigned functions received triage/constants passes and exact-symbol Mac reads where whole-binary output was misaligned. The native arm64 Release dedicated target and the actual Apple client objects for all 13 assigned modules compile at low priority with at most two jobs. Changed source preserves five OFF configurations, including actual diagnostic line expansions; native-on changes are intentional. No new tests, full CI or replays were run. Unless separately stated, corrections are compiled and reviewed, not renderer/GPU/runtime verified. Parent owns integration and runtime checks.

Private evidence: `~/Library/Application Support/CoD2-native-decomp/recon-gfx-frame.noindex/`. The exact per-entry ledger is external in the assigned gfx-frame unit ledger.

## Integrated batch 16 verification

Engine 28e3856 and fixture-only follow-up ea23228 passed both dedicated builds, complete local CI steps 02–13, native-only source guards, per-unit parent/independent reviews and a fresh combined-source review. All five inactive configurations are unchanged; no changed production file uses line macros. Initial step 07 exposed an omitted CTAB register-count input in the existing shader-argument fixture. Supplying the restored field made the complete step 07 rerun pass with unchanged cases and assertions. Packet-container integration also removed a duplicated preprocessor guard, restoring the exact independently reviewed initializer.

Both 2,000-frame replays exactly match both d873794 baselines and each other in players, state hashes and entities. All six Linux logic fields agree, with maximum origin/velocity drift 0.11792/2.0. Existing accelerated-GL raster/saved-screen checks and all 18 depth cases passed ASan/UBSan. No new tests, cases or assertions were added; no i386 byte-parity claim is made.

This batch closes 334 math, shader, array, material, command and frame/setup entries. Fixes cover arithmetic/aliasing, shader ownership/declarations, array and cache lifetime, constant-table routing, command/buffer order, light partitioning and screenshot handling. Full device registration/state/draw and timing gaps remain explicit for separate follow-ups. Dedicated replays do not exercise client rendering; unreached client/error paths remain compiled and reviewed. These checks do not establish a complete rendered frame.
